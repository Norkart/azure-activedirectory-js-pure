Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for JavaScript - PURE (without the #%*ing Angular nonsense)
====================================

Active Directory Authentication Library for JavaScript (ADAL JS) helps you to use Azure AD for handling authentication in your single page applications.

This library is forked from : https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js wich for some unknown reason has ben  shipped with an angular script as well wich is actually not required at all. The main purpose of this fork is to remove that script to have a "pure" starting point.
